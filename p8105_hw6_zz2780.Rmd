# Problem 2

Load the data from Github Repo
```{r}
data2<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv")
```

The code below creates a city_state variable and a binary variable solved indicating whether the homicide is solved, omits cities with missing race or mistake, limits the victim's race to only white or black, and changes victim_age to numeric variable. 
```{r}
data2<-data2%>%
  mutate(
    city_state=paste(city, state, sep=", "),
    solved=if_else(str_starts(disposition, "Closed"),1,0),
    victim_age=as.numeric(victim_age))%>%
  filter(
   !city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL"),
   victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")
  )
```
